# Number of CPUs to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
cpu: 4

# Size of the disk in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# NOTE: value can only be increased after virtual machine has been created.
#
# Default: 100
disk: 60

# Size of the memory in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
memory: 3

# Architecture of the virtual machine (x86_64, aarch64, host).
#
# NOTE: value cannot be changed after virtual machine is created.
# Default: host
arch: aarch64

# Container runtime to be used (docker, containerd).
#
# NOTE: value cannot be changed after virtual machine is created.
# Default: docker
runtime: docker

# Set custom hostname for the virtual machine.
# Default: colima
#          colima-profile_name for other profiles
hostname: colima

# Auto-activate on the Host for client access.
# Setting to true does the following on startup
#  - sets as active Docker context (for Docker runtime).
#  - sets as active Kubernetes context (if Kubernetes is enabled).
# Default: true

# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

# Virtual Machine type (qemu, vz)
# NOTE: this is macOS 13 only. For Linux and macOS <13.0, qemu is always used.
#
# vz is macOS virtualization framework and requires macOS 13
#
# NOTE: value cannot be changed after virtual machine is created.
# Default: qemu
vmType: vz

# Utilise rosetta for amd64 emulation (requires m1 mac and vmType `vz`)
# Default: false
rosetta: false

# Enable nested virtualization for the virtual machine (requires m3 mac and vmType `vz`)
# Default: false
nestedVirtualization: false

# Volume mount driver for the virtual machine (virtiofs, 9p, sshfs).
#
# virtiofs is limited to macOS and vmType `vz`. It is the fastest of the options.
#
# 9p is the recommended and the most stable option for vmType `qemu`.
#
# sshfs is faster than 9p but the least reliable of the options (when there are lots
# of concurrent reads or writes).
#
# NOTE: value cannot be changed after virtual machine is created.
# Default: virtiofs (for vz), sshfs (for qemu)
mountType: sshfs

# Propagate inotify file events to the VM.
# NOTE: this is experimental.
mountInotify: false

# The CPU type for the virtual machine (requires vmType `qemu`).
# Options available for host emulation can be checked with: `qemu-system-$(arch) -cpu help`.
# Instructions are also supported by appending to the cpu type e.g. "qemu64,+ssse3".
# Default: host
cpuType: ""

# Environment variables for the virtual machine.
#
# EXAMPLE
# env:
#   KEY: value
#   ANOTHER_KEY: another value
#
# Default: {}
env: {}
